## Main Body
$~~~~~$In most languages, if someone said you had cancer, it would be a **diagnosis**. In Dutch, it is more likely to be an **insult**. *Kankerlijer* ("cancer-sufferer") is one of a long list of Dutch **profanities** and **expletives** **derived** from diseases. An undesirable person might be told to "**typhus** off" (*optyfussen*) or "get **consumption**" (krijg de tering). If in (American) English you laugh your **ass** off, in Dutch you might "laugh yourself the **pleurisy**" (*lachen je de pleuris*). No one in England has been called a "**poxy** bitch" for centuries, but in the Netherlands you can still call someone a *pokkenteef*. A damned long way is a *klereneind* ("cholera-end"). And so on.

$~~~~$Because **expletives** are based on social **taboos**, in most cultures they are linked to sex, **excrement** or **religion**. Many Dutch **swear** words are as well, but they often feel weaker than the medical ones. *Schijt* is less like its English **cognate** and more like the gentler French *merde*. *Mierenneuker* (“ant-fucker”) is an **anodyne** expression for someone who **fusses** over details. “Whore” is an **insult** in Dutch too, but when the rapper Lil’ Kleine had a **beef** with pop singer Anouk last autumn, he went with the **harsher** kankerhoer (“cancer-whore”).

$~~~~$**Scholars** are not sure why the Dutch **swear** with illnesses. One theory links it to Calvinism, the **puritanical** **strain** of **Protestantism** that caught on here in the 16th century, which holds that the **virtue** of those **destined** for **heaven** will show itself in worldly **prosperity**, health and **hygiene**. “There was a shift in focus from the afterlife to this life, which, for example, **diminished** the strength of ‘God damn it’,” says Marten van der Meulen, a Dutch **linguist** and author of a book on swearing. On this theory, “a **curse** might be stronger if you used something in actual life, like a disease.”

$~~~~$However, there is also what **linguists** call the **frequency** **hypothesis**: the Dutch may **curse** with diseases simply because it caught on. Language, as Laurie Anderson said, is a **virus**. Perhaps someday Dutch kids will **savage** each other on the playground with cries of *coronalijer*.
