## Main Body
*In an **unprecedented** move the **Federal Reserve** said it would buy corporate **bonds**, including new issues and the riskiest **investment-grade debt**, action that it **shied away from** during the financial crisis a decade ago. The central bank is using a **subsidiary** of Black-Rock to manage the investments. It is also buying government debt (unlimited **quantitative easing**), **reviving** a **facility** that enables it to absorb securities backed by student, car and credit-card **loans**, and has **pledged** to help small businesses.*

*Markets had another **manic** week, as investors **swung between** **despondency** and optimism. On March 24th the s&P 500 rose by 9.4%, its biggest one-day gain since October 2008. The NASDAQ was up by 8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 11.4%. The FTSE 100 and German DAX recorded similar **leaps.***

*Easing the pressure on big banks, the Bank of England cancelled its annual stress tests. This came after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.1%, the lowest in its 326-year history.*

*A measure of business activity **compiled** by IHS Markit fell to record lows for America, Britain and the **euro** zone. Worse is yet to come. The survey was taken before many of the more **stringent** **lockdowns** on companies and personal movement were introduced.*

*With passenger numbers down by 70% on Britain's railways the government **suspended** for at least six months the **franchise** system through which train companies operate on routes. The Department for Transport is doing this so that it can take on all the **revenue** and cost risk, in effect nationalising any losses. Train companies will continue to run services for a small fee.*

*The International Air Transport Association increased its **estimate** of revenue losses for the airline industry this year to \$250bn. Global carriers have asked governments to **bail** them out, but environmentalists want this linked to **swifter** action on carbon emissions.*

*Virgin Australia reportedly asked Australia's **antitrust** **authority** to **investigate** public comments made by Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, Virgin's arch-rival. Mr Joyce has suggested that Virgin should not receive state aid during the crisis, implying that it is "badly managed", and has said he wants his airline to be the "last man standing". Reports suggest Virgin is worried that Qantas is using the crisis to reduce competition. Meanwhile, and despite stretched credit markets, Qantas was able to raise A$1.1bn($635m)in bank loans.*

*Norwegian Air, which was already struggling before covid-19 grounded flights, received its first cash injection from Norway's government after **securing** a **rescue** package for the country's airlines. Under the deal, commercial lenders provide 10% of loan guarantees and the government the remaining 90%.*

*Boeing suspended production at its factory near Seattle for two weeks. Washington state has been hit particularly hard by covid-19 and dozens of Boeing's workers have **contracted** the disease; one man has died. Airbus reopened its plants in France and Spain after a four-day hiatus, but reduced their output.*

*Workers at several Amazon warehouses in America tested positive for covid-19, forcing some of them to close while they were cleaned. Amazon is hiring 100,000 more people to **cope** with a **surge** in online shopping, but hundreds of employees have signed a **petition** **urging** the company to do more to protect them.*

*A sales update from Target provided a **glimpse** into the impact of coronavirus on large **retailers**. Total sales were up by more than 20% in March so far compared with the same month last year, and by 50% for food and household **essentials**. Clothing sales were down by a fifth, however.*

*Nike revealed that 80% of the stores that sell its products in China have reopened, after closing in February soon after the start of the virus outbreak.*

*SoftBank announced a sale of up to ¥4.5trn (\$41bn) of **assets** to fund a share buy-back plan and reduce its debt. The troubled Japanese **conglomerate's** share price **soared** after the announcement. That was not enough to stop Moody's from cutting its rating for SoftBank's bonds by two **notches**.*

*Just in time for the family lockdown, Disney+ launched in Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and several other European countries. Being stuck indoors has led to a surge in **streaming**, which has caused Netflix, Amazon Prime and others to reduce their playback quality in Europe to ensure **films** don't **stutter**.*
